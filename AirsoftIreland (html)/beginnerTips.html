Starting out in airsoft can be a daunting and expensive decision, in this short guide we will get you onto the fast track to playing airsoft with the bare minimum,
As there is an over saturation of options available to you, from uniforms and accessories to replicas, I would advise all new players to avoid making a large investment into anything that is not required to just get out and play.</p>
<p><strong>For your first time playing I would recommend the following:</strong><br>
Most airsoft arenas offer a service whereby you can rent equipment, this includes a replica, facemask for your safety, gloves for your protection and BBs to serve you an entire day, this can save you on an initial investment, however if airsoft has become something you wish to continue as a sport and want to keep playing multiple times after I would recommend that you purchase a mask and your very own replica.
When choosing your first mask I recommend highly on getting the best you can afford and choosing a mask that is functional over aesthetically pleasing, you cannot put a price on safety, and while some of the very cheap masks that range from five to fifteen euro work, they can suffer from lens degeneration which can lead to accidents over your time playing airsoft.</p>
<p>Before choosing your first airsoft replica, it is advised that you look into our <a href="airsoftBrands.html">brand information.</a>
not all brands are equal, some are more affordable but can show this in performance, there are many websites you can view that are from Irelands airsoft retailers to see a very wide selection of airsoft replicas, we have a list of all known retailers in ireland for airsoft <a href="irishRetailers.html">HERE</a>, this will assist you in choosing something that not only suits you astheticly, but will fit into whatever budget you may have. </p>
<p>Lastly remember that airsoft is a game have fun, however for your safety, you can view the Ireland Airsoft safety guide <a href="safetyInfo.html">HERE</a> Airsoft is a new sport to Ireland with specific set of rules and regulations so, before you attend any airsoft arena or purchase an airsoft replica, please ensure you are aware of the laws surrounding airsoft, we have a dedicated page to inform you about the laws and regulations in airsoft <a href="legal.html">HERE</a> 
 Be mindful of the laws regarding airsoft, an informed player is a safe player.
