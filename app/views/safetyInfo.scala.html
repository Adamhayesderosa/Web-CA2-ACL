<p><strong>Airgun Safety Rules & Precautions</strong></p>

<p>Not only do airsoft guns appear to be real, they also shoot plastic pellets. Many of the models are also fully automatic. The speed at which airsoft BBs come out of airsoft guns is much slower than the speed that BBs are shot out of a traditional BB gun. Generally speaking, this speed allows people to shoot at each other with airsoft guns safely, under certain conditions. The first condition is eyewear. Never, ever, shoot at someone who is not wearing proper eye protection. Proper eye protection means eye goggles rated at least ANSI Z87.1 or paintball goggles. Proper eye protection is not military sun/dust/wind goggles, ski goggles, or shop goggles. Do not risk your own eyes or take on liability for your friend’s eyes. Always wear proper eye protection when shooting airsoft guns!</p>

<p>Also please be aware of the speeds at which all airsoft guns used in an airsoft game are shooting. Typical out-of-the-box airsoft guns shoot at ranges anywhere from 250 feet per second to 350 feet per second. Airsoft guns can be modified to shoot faster. Speeds between 375 feet per second and 400 feet per second are usually the maximum speeds US airsoft teams will allow. Make sure that anyone firing an airsoft gun over 400 feet per second is experienced, can accurately judge distance, and does not engage targets at close range. Never mix real BB guns into an airsoft gun game. If you are unsure of an airsoft gun’s firing speed either buy a chronograph to measure the speed or simply do not allow it at a game.</p>

<p>The simplest rule to remember with airsoft guns is to treat them as real guns. An accidental discharge at close range can have any number of damaging results including, but not limited too, broken teeth and damaged eyes.</p>

<p>When transporting your gun to and from a game carry it in a gun case. Not only is a gun case the safest means of transportation it also naturally protects your gun (airsoft guns can be quite fragile) and makes a great place to store airsoft pistols and spare magazines. For many areas a gun case is the only way to legally transport your airsoft gun. Remember, it is very difficult to visibly distinguish an airsoft gun from a real gun.</p>

<p><strong>AIRGUNS ARE NOT TOYS. RESPONSIBLE ADULT SUPERVISION IS REQUIRED. MISUSE OR CARELESS USE MAY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.</strong></p>

<p><strong>READ THE OWNER’S OPERATION MANUAL PRIOR TO HANDLING ANY AIRGUN. PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ALL WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS.</strong> It is your duty to know and obey all laws governing the use and ownership of air guns in your city, town, province, state, and/or country.</p>
